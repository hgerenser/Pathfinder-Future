    <p>As automation and AI reshape the job landscape, young adults must adapt. Here are a few practical ways to stay ahead:</p>
    <h3>1. Explore Emerging Fields</h3>
    <p>Don’t limit yourself to traditional roles. Industries like renewable energy, cybersecurity, biotechnology and human–AI collaboration are growing rapidly. Use tools like career exploration platforms and informational interviews to learn what’s out there.</p>
    <h3>2. Build Transferable Skills</h3>
    <p>While technical skills evolve quickly, transferable skills such as problem solving, communication and creativity remain valuable. Courses, clubs and volunteer projects can help you develop these competencies.</p>
    <h3>3. Stay Curious and Keep Learning</h3>
    <p>The future of work will involve continual learning. Follow trusted news sources, subscribe to newsletters, and take online courses to stay informed about new technologies and trends.</p>
    <p>Above all, remember that career paths are becoming more fluid. It’s okay to change direction as you learn more about yourself and the opportunities available.</p>
