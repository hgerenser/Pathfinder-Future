        <h4>Is this only for kids going into tech or certain careers?</h4>
        <p>No. Our programs are designed for any student (and their family) who wants to be prepared for the future. Whether you dream of becoming a doctor, artist, plumber or aren’t sure yet, the principles are the same: adaptability, curiosity and resilience.</p>
